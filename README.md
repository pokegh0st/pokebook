## What makes Poke!Book so cool?

- Workspace split into two independent notepads – use them however you want! Say, you can jot down notes in one and write the poem in the second.
- Everything is stored locally – no need to trust anyone to keep your poems nice and safe! Reload the page, close the tab, even reboot your computer, everything will stay there!
- The draft is autosaved with every single character written – don't worry about crashes or blackouts so you can focus on the writing!
- Click "New poem" and you immediately have a clean workspace – previous poem is saved in the Poem Stash™!
- View, edit and delete your previously written poems and store as many as your computer can handle!
